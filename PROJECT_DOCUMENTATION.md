# 11SE Task 2 2025 - Typing Speed Tester
## By Alex

# Sprint 1
## **Requirements Definition**
### **Functional Requirements**
- **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 

The user needs to be able to view the words for the typing test which has randomised words, which will end once the user has typed 25 words. The system will then gather the data from the user's test and calculate the WPM (Words Per Minute) from it.

- **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?

They need to be able to type the displayed words. If the user makes an error, they will not be able to progress in the test until they type the right letter. There will also be an exit button on the UI or on the window.

- **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system? What needs to be output for the user?

The user will get their results for the typing test. It will show their WPM from the typing test that they completed, as well as how long it took them to type all of it.

### **Non-functional Requirements**
- **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform? 

The system needs to be able to register the input from the user instantly, and show it.

- **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?

- **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?

## **Determining Specifications**
### **Functional Secifications**
- **User Requirements**
    - What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.

- **Inputs & Outputs**
    - What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?

- **Core Features**
    - At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?

- **User Interaction**
    - How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?

- **Error Handling**
    - What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?

### **Non-functional Specifications**
- **Performance**
    - How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?

- **Useability / Accessibility**
    - How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

- **Reliability**
    - What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Illogical calculation? Menu navigation going to wrong places?

### **Use Cases**
- **Actors:** Who interacts with the system (e.g., user, external system).

- **Preconditions:** Conditions that must be met before the use case starts.

- **Main Flow:** The step-by-step process of how the interaction occurs.

- **Alternative Flows (if needed):** Variations or exceptions to the main flow.

**Postconditions:** The expected outcome or result after the use case is completed.
