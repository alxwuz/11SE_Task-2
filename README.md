# AlxType
## Overview
Welcome to this program, where you can test your typing speed by typing a prompt of words to determine your WPM (Words Per Minute), to see how fast your typing skills are (the higher the better).

## Installation
To run the program, you will need to download python (the latest versions is recommended). After, download the .zip file of this (you can see from the green button), then extract it and open it. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal/command prompt with the folder navigated to. This will install the dependencies needed for running the program, which you can then run `AlxType.py` (preferably in a code editor such as VSCode). The other modules already come with Python, so there is no need to install them.
